                <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m an AI and Machine Learning engineering student currently
                    pursuing my bachelor’s degree, driven by a deep interest in
                    understanding how systems — technical, biological, and
                    business — actually work.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before college, I represented my school football team and
                    learned the value of discipline, teamwork, and performing
                    under pressure. Today, that same mindset shapes how I
                    approach problem-solving, learning, and building with
                    technology.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I enjoy working at the intersection of logic and creativity,
                    where ideas are tested, broken, and refined into solutions
                    that matter.
                </p>

                <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

                <p>
                    I’ve built AI-powered applications including chatbots,
                    database-driven systems, and retrieval-augmented assistants
                    using Python, FastAPI, and modern AI APIs. My focus is on
                    turning concepts into working systems, not just demos.
                </p>

                <h2>🏆 Accomplishments</h2>

                <p>
                    Winner of two hackathons and Top 15 at a national-level
                    hackathon. Competitive environments push me to think
                    clearly, adapt quickly, and execute effectively.

                <h2>🌮 Beyond Code</h2>

                <h3>Sports & Competition</h3>
                <p>
                    I prefer sports over movies and series — especially
                    football, cricket, and basketball. Representing my school
                    team and competing against senior players taught me
                    resilience and mental strength.
                </p>

                <h3>From Football Grounds to Hackathons</h3>
                <p>
                    In college, that competitive spirit shifted from football
                    tournaments to hackathons, where problem-solving replaced
                    physical play but the intensity remained the same.
                </p>

                <h3>Interests Beyond Technology</h3>
                <p>
                    Alongside AI and software engineering, I have a keen
                    interest in physics and biology. I enjoy connecting ideas
                    across fields, believing that strong solutions often come
                    from interdisciplinary thinking.
